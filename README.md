# hello-world

My name is John Gierke.

I am studying to be a Mechanical Engineer at Portland State University. I am interested in Aerospace, Aeronautics, Sustainable Energy, 
Mechanically Transformative Living and Work Spaces, and "Open-Source Sustainable Living Models".

My dream is to live on a large rural property to use as a research and development living space to come up with marketable open-source, 
affordable technologies and processes to live off the grid while still utilizing all of the benefits of the latest technology. I
hope one day to develop organic food growing and processing methods that require minimal labor and are quick to implement. I hope 
to scale down solar, wind, and hydropower to a level that can supply the electrical needs of any moderately-sized family home in
any location in the world. I am also very interested in achieving that goal by making the energy and spatial footprint of the home
very small. How do you do this? For one, make it very mobile and able to modify its space. Design the home to be able to fold up
somewhat, as well as create tranformative interior living and workspaces by utilizing unused space within the walls, floors, and
ceilings.

Also, once the living requirements are met, I want to have my own research and development shop where I can explore new technologies
and create solutions to many societal problems. One major goal is to remotely collaborate with others in the field of aeronautical and 
aerospace research to build towards a future of space faring civilization, in effect using incredible technologies and conclusions 
developed for those purposes to solve many of the imminent scenarios and challenges humanity faces here on Earth.

Thank you.
